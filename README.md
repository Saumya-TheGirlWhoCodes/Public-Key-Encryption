# Public-Key-Encryption

### Problem
On the Internet, two computers often want to exchange secure data with each other. When we type some password into any website's login screen, we want our computer to send that data safely to the required website. We do not want to worry that an attacker might be monitoring our Internet traffic and watching the password go across the wires. 

### Solution
Public key encryption to the rescue! It's an asymmetric encryption technique which uses different keys for encryption and decryption, allowing computers over the Internet to securely communicate with each other.
